Your interface must include the following components: 
XA text label
_A text label with an icon
XFunctional buttons that do something when pressed
XOne must have text
XOne must have an image in it
XEvent handling
_A checkbox 
XA text entry box 
XA labeled panel with GUI components on it (e.g., similar to a JPanel) 
XA functioning tooltip on a component
XA menu with at least two options
_A button that when pressed, grabs information from a website/API and displays it in the interface
_A pane that allows you to draw lines with the mouse 

_Finally, it should be possible to enter information into the interface, quit the app entirely, restart the app, and have the prior state restored. 

While you can implement these components in a boring or nonsensical interface, much more interesting would be to see an implementation that relates to what your team may be developing. However, remember, this is an individual project. All the code must be yours and yours only. 

What to post  

Create a short screen capture video showing the app running. Zip and submit the screen capture, all your code, and instructions on how to run your code to your course website named “I5: Individual Assignment #5 – GUI Implementation.” 

In addition, please post your video to Blackboard by the deadline.

Background:
My term project idea is a virtual office hours service in the form of a real-time chat for when instructors can't make it to in-person office hours. I implemented some of the front-end functionality of our idea, including making a chatbox that can display text entered by the user (the server-client functionality isn't implemented yet since I figured it was out of the scope of this assignment.) ***LIST OF THINGIES HERE***

To run this code:
1. Using the terminal, cd into the folder containing this code and enter 'http-server' into the command line. (http-server can be installed by following the instructions at this link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
2. The terminal will list available ports from which to run the program. Copy-paste one of them into a browser window and add '/index.html' (For example, when I run my code locally, the contents of my browser's URL bar is '')
3. From here, it is possible to navigate the program like a normal website.
