Background:
My term project idea is a virtual office hours service in the form of a real-time chat for when instructors can't make it to in-person office hours. I implemented some of the front-end functionality of our idea, including making a chatbox that can display text entered by the user (the server-client functionality isn't implemented yet since I figured it was out of the scope of this assignment.) There is also functionality for a logo and main menu.

Your interface must include the following components: 
A text label - checkbox label on the home page
A text label with an icon - checkbox label on the home page
Functional buttons that do something when pressed
	One must have text - "Send" button in the chatbox
	One must have an image in it - "X" button in the View My Info page
Event handling - displaying the text input in the chatbox
A checkbox - on the home page
A text entry box - on the chatbox
A labeled panel with GUI components on it - chatbox
A functioning tooltip on a component - tooltip on NUVirtual logo
A menu with at least two options - main menu
A button that when pressed, grabs information from a website/API and displays it in the interface - Google search API on View My Info page
A pane that allows you to draw lines with the mouse - [not implemented]

To run this code:
1. Using the terminal, cd into the folder containing this code and enter 'http-server' into the command line. (http-server can be installed by following the instructions at this link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
2. The terminal will list available ports from which to run the program. Copy-paste one of them into a browser window and add '/index.html' (For example, when I run my code locally, the contents of my browser's URL bar is 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html')
3. From here, it is possible to navigate the program like a normal website.
